        #### Huancavelica Region
        
        The analysis of high school proximity in Huancavelica reveals significant geographic disparities. 
        This mountainous region presents challenging terrain with elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters, 
        which directly impacts educational access. Primary schools with few nearby secondary schools 
        tend to be located in remote rural areas with limited transportation infrastructure, 
        whereas schools with better access to secondary education are typically situated in more 
        densely populated areas with better road connectivity.
        
        #### Ayacucho Region
        
        Similarly in Ayacucho, geography plays a decisive role in educational access. The region's 
        varied terrain, from high Andean zones to lower valleys, creates natural barriers to educational 
        infrastructure development. Urban centers show clustering of both primary and secondary schools, 
        while rural communities often have primary schools with limited or no nearby secondary education options. 
        This urban-rural divide highlights the challenges in providing equitable educational access across 
        diverse geographical contexts.
